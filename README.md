## Trilogy Boot-Camp Assignment 6

### Assignment Objective: 
Use Javascript to create buttons based on a topic array. Add a Giphy API which will allow the buttons to populate 10 still giphy images. The user can animate or pause each link by clicking on the image. The user can also add buttons by inputting an artist name into a search field.

### Bonuse Objectives:
I created the website to utilize both a Giphy API and an OMDB API. When the user selects a musical artist, the site shows 10 gif images and a possible movie recommendation (typically a documentary). The user also has the option to add gifs to a favorites list.
